# Introduction
Build your foundation in Python, the common language of data science. An intuitive, deep understanding of this language will allow you to build custom tools in data science and machine learning that can be easily deployed, scaled, and repurposed.

The breakdown for this course is as follows:

*	Data Topics
    * Introduction to Python; Lists, Dictionaries, and Flow Control; Functions; Pandas; NumPy; Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas
*	Software Topics
    *	Object Oriented Programming; Debugging
*	Sessions
    * S1: Python and Jupyter
    * S2: Data Structures and Flow
    * S3: Functions and Debugging
    * S4: Object Oriented Programming
    * S5: Pandas
    * S6: Matplotlib
    * S7: NumPy
*	Exercises
    * E1: Practice with Python and Jupyter Notebooks
    * E2: Practice with Flow Control
    * E3: Practice with Functions
