Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug, only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong dataset or with the wrong configuration parameters, or are using the wrong version of the software entirely. Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we’re tired, frustrated, and up against a deadline, which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions are almost never worthwhile. -[swcarpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/11-debugging/index.html)\n",
